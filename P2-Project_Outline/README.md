## Submission Instructions

### Overview

    The goal of my project is to help users find new music to listen to.
    When setting up a profile, the user will provide examples of bands/genres they enjoy. They will then be provided with recommendations for
    bands they might also enjoy. They can apply further filters to these recommendations as well. There will also be a basic browsing page where
    the user can independently find bands. The user will be able to update
    their list of band interests, and the website will continue to use this information to find new bands for them. I would also like to add a friend functionality that allows users to add their friends and recommend music to them on the site. There will be a separate page to display friend recommendations. 

### Features

    User Login: Users will have to create an account and login to use the site, I will have to implement some validation for the login page.

    Browse Music: Users will be able to browse bands, applying filters to the search results such as genre, name, etc...

    Discover: Based on the user's list of interests, this page will display recommendations for them, these recommendations can be filtered as well.

    Friends: Users will be able to add friends by their username.

    Friend Recommendations: Friends will be able to recommend bands to each other, these recommendations will appear on their own page.
